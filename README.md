### V851s
V851S is a new generation of high-performance H.264/H.265 encoding SoC targeted for the field of IP Camera.

It integrates the single Cortex-A7 core@900MHz, RISC-V@600MHz and 0.5 Tops NPU and supports various intelligent application such as human detection and crossing alarm. V851S is also designed with a new generation of high-performance ISP image processor and video encoder with professional encoding quality, low encoding bit rate and mainstream-level image processing capability. In addition, V851S supports 64MB DDR2 and rich peripheral interfaces, such as USB, SDIO and Ethernet, to meet the requirements of various IP Camera products.

### Docker image

To facilitate development, we have prepared a Docker image for use. Docker has built a basic environment and SDK, which can be developed directly

```
docker pull gloomyghost/yuzukilizard
```

Aliyun Mirror:
```
docker pull registry.cn-hangzhou.aliyuncs.com/gloomyghost/yuzukilizard
```
